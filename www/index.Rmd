----------------

#### Instructor

Amelia McNamara (`amcnamara@smith.edu`, McConnell 211) Student hours: Mondays from 3:00-4:30, Thursdays from 10:30-12:00, and by appointment, in McConnell 211.

#### Description

The world is growing increasingly reliant on collecting and analyzing information to help people make decisions. Because of this, the ability to communicate effectively about data is an important component of future job prospects across nearly all disciplines. In this course, students will learn the foundations of information visualization and sharpen their skills in communicating using data. Throughout the semester, we will explore concepts in decision-making, human perception, color theory, and storytelling as they apply to data-driven communication. Whether you're an aspiring data scientist or you just want to learn new ways of presenting information, this course will help you build a strong foundation in how to talk to people about data.

**Prerequisite**: None.
